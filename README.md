# Taiwan-Real-Estate
Using linear regression to predict the valuation of real estate in Taiwan. This was a final project in my statistical
modeling course. The goal was to use various techniques (OLS, penalized ridge, and random forest) to predict the value
of property in Taiwan based on several predictors. This included exploratory analysis, minor data cleaning, and
evaluating the effectiveness of the different models.
